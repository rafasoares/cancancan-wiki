CanCan makes two assumptions about your application.

* You have an @Ability@ class which defines the permissions.
* You have a @current_user@ method in the controller which returns the current user model.

You can override both of these by defining the @current_ability@ method in your @ApplicationController@. The current method looks like this.

<pre>
def current_ability
  @current_ability ||= Ability.new(current_user)
end
</pre>

The @Ability@ class and @current_user@ method can easily be changed to something else.

<pre>
# in ApplicationController
def current_ability
  @current_ability ||= AccountAbility.new(current_account)
end
</pre>

That's it! See [[Accessing Request Data]] for a more complex example of what you can do here.
