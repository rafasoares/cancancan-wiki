A hash of conditions can be passed for defining user permissions in the @Ability@ class. Here the user will only have permission to read active projects which he owns.

<pre>
can :read, Project, :active => true, :user_id => user.id
</pre>

It is important to only use database columns for these conditions so it can be used for [[Fetching Records]].

You can use nested hashes to define conditions on associations. Here the project can only be read if the category it belongs to is visible.

<pre>
can :read, Project, :category => { :visible => true }
</pre>

An array or range can be passed to match multiple values. Here the user can only read projects of priority 1 through 3.

<pre>
can :read, Project, :priority => 1..3
</pre>
