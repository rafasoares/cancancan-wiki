Use the @can?@ method in the controller or view to check the user's permission for a given action and object.

<pre>
can? :destroy, @project
</pre>

You can also pass the class instead of an instance (if you don't have one handy).

<pre>
<% if can? :create, Project %>
  <%= link_to "New Project", new_project_path %>
<% end %>
</pre>

The "cannot?" method is for convenience and performs the opposite check of "can?"

<pre>
cannot? :destroy, @project
</pre>

See  [[Custom Actions]] for checking abilities on other actions.
