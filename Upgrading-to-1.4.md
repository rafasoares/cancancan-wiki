**CanCan version 1.4** is a large update with several backwards-incompatbile changes, specifically concerning blocks.

See [[Upgrading to 1.3]] if you have not upgraded to 1.3 yet. Also check out the [[CHANGELOG|http://github.com/ryanb/cancan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rdoc]] for the full list of changes.

## Loading `index` action

A collection of resources is automatically loaded in the `index` action using `accessible_by`.

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  load_and_authorize_resource
  def index
    # @products automatically set to Product.accessible_by(current_ability)
  end
end
```

Since this is a scope you can build on it further.

```ruby
def index
  @products = @products.paginate(:page => params[:page])
end
```

The `@products` variable will not be set if `Product` does not respond to `accessible_by` (for example if you aren't using Active Record). It will also not be set if you are using blocks in any of the `can` definitions because that is incompatible with `accessible_by`.


## Blocks in `can` definitions

There are many backward-incompatible changes regarding blocks in `can` definitions.

The block is no longer triggered if a class is passed in to the `can?` check. This makes the behavior consistent with the conditions hash and means you no longer need to check for nil.

```ruby
can :read, Project do |project|
  project.publicly_available?
end
can? :read, Project # returns true without triggering block
can? :read, @project # triggers block
```

The action and class are no longer passed to the block when using `:manage` or `:all` arguments. Only the object is passed in. Here are a couple examples:

```ruby
can :manage, :Project do |project|
  # ...
end

can :manage, :all do |object|
  # ...
end
```

If you need the old behavior (like when defining [[Abilities in Database]]), you can call `can` without any arguments and everything will be passed to the block.

```ruby
can do |action, subject_class, subject|
  # ...
end
```

This block will be triggered with every check even when a class is passed in to the `can?` call.


## Internationalization

The AccessDenied messages can be customized through internationalization. For example:

```yaml
# in config/locales/en.yml
en:
  unauthorized:
    manage:
      all: "Not authorized to %{action} %{subject}."
      user: "Not allowed to manage other user accounts."
    update:
      project: "Not allowed to update this project."
```

Notice `manage` and `all` can be used to generalize the subject and actions. Also `%{action}` and `%{subject}` can be used as variables in the message.


## Ensure authorization is performed

If you want to be certain authorization is not forgotten in some controller action, add `check_authorization` to your `ApplicationController`.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  check_authorization
end
```

This will add an `after_filter` to ensure authorization takes place in every inherited controller action. If not it will raise an exception. You can skip this check by adding `skip_authorization` to that controller. Both of these methods take the same arguments as `before_filter` so you can exclude certain actions with `:only` and `:except`.


## Nested Resources

It is now possible to load a nested resource through a method. This is often used with `current_user`.

```ruby
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  load_and_authorize_resource :through => :current_user
end
```

Here everything will be loaded through the `current_user.projects` association.

This parent resource is now required and will raise an error when `nil`. If you want the parent to be optional, add the `:shallow => true` option.


## Inherited Resources

It will automatically detect if you are using Inherited Resources and load the resource through that. The `load_resource` is still necessary since Inherited Resources does lazy loading.

```ruby
class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
  load_and_authorize_resource
end
```

## Default attributes in `new` and `create` actions

The `new` and `create` actions will initialize the resource with the attributes in the hash conditions. For example, if we have this `can` definition.

```ruby
can :manage, Product, :discontinued => false
```

Then the product will be built with that attribute in the controller.

```ruby
@product = Product.new(:discontinued => false)
```

This way it will pass authorization when the user accesses the `new` action. The attributes are still overridden by whatever is passed by the user in `params[:product]`.


## SQL in `can` definition

If you are defining `can` definitions with a block, it's now possible to pass SQL conditions as an argument for use with `accessible_by`.

```ruby
can :read, :project, ["publicly_available = ?", true] do |project|
  project.publicly_available?
end
```

In this simple case it would be better to [[define the conditions with a hash|Defining Abilities with Hashes]] instead of a block, but this will be useful in more complex scenarios where a hash is not possible.


## Running Specs

If you want to contribute to this project, a `Gemfile` has been added to make it easy to start developing and running the specs. Just run `bundle` and `rake` to run the specs. The specs currently do not work in Ruby 1.9 due to the RR mocking framework.
