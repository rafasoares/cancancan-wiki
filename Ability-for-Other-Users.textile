What if you want to determine the abilities of a @User@ record that is not the @current_user@? Maybe we want to see if another user can update an article.

<pre>
some_user.ability.can? :update, @article
</pre>

You can easily add an @ability@ method in the @User@ model.

<pre>
def ability
  @ability ||= Ability.new(self)
end
</pre>

I also recommend adding delegation so @can?@ can be called directly from the user.

<pre>
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  delegate :can?, :cannot?, :to => :ability
  # ...
end

some_user.can? :update, @article
</pre>

Finally, if you're using this approach, it's best to override the @current_ability@ method in the @ApplicationController@ so it uses the same method.

<pre>
def current_ability
  current_user.ability
end
</pre>

The downside of this approach is that [[Accessing Request Data]] is not as easy, so it depends on the needs of your application.
