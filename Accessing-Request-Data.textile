What if you need to modify the permissions based on something outside of the User object? For example, let's say you want to blacklist certain IP addresses from creating comments. The IP address is accessible through @request.remote_ip@ but the Ability class does not have access to this. It's easy to modify what you pass to the Ability object by overriding the `current_ability` method in @ApplicationController@.

<pre>
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  #...

  private

  def current_ability
    Ability.new(user, request.remote_ip)
  end
end

class Ability
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user, ip_address)
    can :create, Comment do |comment|
      # check if ip_address is bad
    end
  end
end
</pre>

This concept can apply to @session@ and @cookies@ as well.

You may wonder, why I pass only the IP Address instead of the entire @request@ object? I prefer to pass only the information needed, this makes testing and debugging the behavior easier.
